# Encrypt/Decrypt Program
The following program allows you to decrypt and encrpyt different files symmetrically, such as text files, pdf files, png files etc. It has a simple user interface,when the the main file is run, you are greeted with 5 buttons, which are the following, encrypt all, decrypt all, encrypt file, decrypt file and exit. 
Encrypt all, encrypts all the files which are present in the files folder, regardless if the files are of different types.
Similar to encrypt all, the decrypt all button, decrypts all files within the files folder. 
Encrypt file, encrypts a file of your choice, no matter where the file is located.
Decrypt file, decrypts a file of your choice.
Exit allows you to exit the application.
When the file SecretGenKey is ran, in the console you will be able to see the symmetric key used.
## IMPORTANT
As far as we tested, this program works only in Eclipse IDE, when the encrypt all or decrypt all buttons are pressed, if running in Visual Studio Code, you will get an exception in the console Inccorect Algorithm Parameters: null.
